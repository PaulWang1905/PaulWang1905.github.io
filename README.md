## About Me

Hi, I am Puyu Paul Wang, call me Paul if you like.
I am a graduate student at Shanghai Normal University majoring in musicology. 
I play the double bass, guitar and a little bit piano. As a musician, my hobby is playing with linux and coding. My major interest is to help computer understand music 
and the structure of music itself and even to compose or create music. Stilling working on the website. Check back soon.
