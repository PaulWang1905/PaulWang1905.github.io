Hi, vistor.  
Welcome.   
I am a graduate student at Shanghai Normal University majoring in musicology. 
I play the double bass, guitar and a little bit piano.
As a musician, my hobby is playing with linux and coding.
My major interest used to be helping computer to understand music and the structure of music 
itself and even to compose or create music.
Right now I am working on semantic web,  Linked Open Data and its application on music and music cultural heritage. 
I am familiar with CIDOC CRM.
